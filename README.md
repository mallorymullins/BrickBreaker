This is a free and fun interactive game that takes you back to your childhood. Specifically those days when you arnt sure what to play and cool math had your back.

I decided to make a Brick Breaker because as I was going through a list of examples it really popped out at me. All of the other ones seemed to have a boring outcome to me, however breaking things always seems fun to me.
